### Overview

This is a camera app that continuously classifies the money in the frames
seen by your device's back camera, with the option to use a quantized model.

The application should be run on a physical Android device.

### Building

* Open Android Studio. From the Welcome screen, select Open an existing
    Android Studio project.

* From the Open File or Project window that appears, navigate to and select
    the tensorflow-lite/examples/image_classification/android directory.
    Click OK.

* If it asks you to do a Gradle Sync, click OK.

* With your Android device connected to your computer and developer mode
    enabled, click on the green Run arrow in Android Studio.

### Models used

I have used models from the tensorflow teachable machine learning.
